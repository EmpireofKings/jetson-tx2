# jetson-tx2
Independent study at the University of Colorado Boulder about the NVIDIA Jetson TX2
To install this project onto your linux machine, use git
Simply type into the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/matthewdhanley/jetson-tx2.git
```

Once it's there, you can run the following command to update it within the jetson-tx2 directory:
```
git pull origin master
```

or if you simply want to overwrite all files
```
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

I have included a shell script so you can simply run:
```
./git.sh
```
to update all your files (will overwrite any changes).

That's it!
